#### What have you done for your project so far?

Went over Unity engine and managed to create a raw game of just standard brick breaker.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Some small things including making the game faster after each hit of the small controllable bar and figuring out a way of making the levels harder.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Surpisingly not many, but Unity is a little but of a learning curve, but I understood the process relatively quickly.
